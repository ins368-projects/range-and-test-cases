# Test Cases

## Statement

Go to [Range](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Range/) and develop that. In synthesis, you need to code the following 10 methods:

1. [x] Constructor
2. [x] contains
3. [] does not contains
4. [x] all points
5. [] ContainsRange
6. [] Does not ContainsRange
7. [x] endPoints
8. [] overlapsRange
9. [] equals
10.[] not equals

For each one of them make two test case, the first for a successful execution of the method and the second for an unusual or unexpected execution or behavior. In total there will be 40 test cases.

**Create 2 videos**:

1. Make a video writing the test cases plan.
2. Make a video writing the code and testing it.

## Commands to compile

Example using the compilation command: `kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar`
Example runing the .jar file: `java -jar hello.jar`
