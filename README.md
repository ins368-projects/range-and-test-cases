# Test Cases

## Statement

Go to [Range](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Range/) and develop that. In synthesis, you need to code the following 10 methods:

1. Constructor
2. contains
3. does not contains
4. all points
5. ContainsRange
6. Does not ContainsRange
7. endPoints
8. overlapsRange
9. equals
10. not equals

For each one of them make two test case, the first for a successful execution of the method and the second for an unusual or unexpected execution or behavior. In total there will be 40 test cases.

**Create 2 videos**:

1. Make a video writing the test cases plan.
2. Make a video writing the code and testing it.

## Commands to compile

Example using the compilation command: `kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar`
Example runing the .jar file: `java -jar hello.jar`
